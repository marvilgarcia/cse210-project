I‚Äôve made big strides, but now as I take on new challenges, old anger habits seem to resurface. I noticed that the more angry and frustrated I become, the more I naturally turn inward and the less I pray. Thank you for sharing your journey, I really really need this and I feel humbled by it. I love how Jesus prayed more earnestly when He was in agony. I will try to be like Him in that way ‚ù§"));
